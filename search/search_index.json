The short answer is no. Hunt3r is built around a methodology that we have adapted to our needs and what we do with the data we collect, rather than launching an arsenal of tools that do more or less the same thing we prefer to take our time to test them individually and select the ones that have the best results and best suit our needs. Why XYZ Platform is not included ? Simply because it's a platform we don't use and therefore we don't have the data to integrate it easily. However, don't hesitate to make a Pull Request. Why XYZ Provider is not included ? Version 1.0 is only available with Scaleway as it is the one we use on a daily basis, however we are planning to integrate other cloud providers with at least AWS in the first time.","title":"Faq"},{"location":"security/","text":"Security Not being a developer and even if it were, it is not impossible that Hunt3r suffers from security weaknesses.
